"WebSub provides a common mechanism for communication between publishers of "
"any kind of Web content and their subscribers, based on HTTP web hooks. "
"Subscription requests are relayed through hubs, which validate and verify "
"the request. Hubs then distribute new and updated content to subscribers "
"when it becomes available. WebSub was previously known as PubSubHubbub."

"Fediverse is a portmanteau of \"federation\" and \"universe\". It is a "
"common, informal name for a somewhat broad federation of social network "
"servers whose main purpose is microblogging, the sharing of short, public "
"messages.<br />By running social network software that supports a standard "
"set of protocols called ActivityPub, independently run servers can connect "
"to the Fediverse, allowing its users to follow and receive short messages "
"from each other, regardless of which particular ActivityPub server "
"implementation they are running. The Fediverse is built on Free Software. "
"Some of its social networks are vaguely Twitter-ish in style (for example "
"Mastodon, or GNU Social, similar in activities and their microblogging "
"function), while other federated platforms include more communication and "
"transaction options that are instead comparable to Google+ or Facebook "
"(such as is the case with Friendica). (Wikipedia)"

" OStatus lets people on different social networks follow each other. It "
"applies a group of related protocols (PubSubHubbub, ActivityStreams, "
"Salmon, Portable Contacts, and Webfinger) to this problem in what we "
"believe is a simple and obvious way. OStatus is a minimal specification for "
"distributed status updates or microblogging.<br />Many social applications "
"can be modelled with status updates, however. Practically any software that "
"generates RSS or Atom feeds could be OStatus-enabled. Travel networks, "
"event invitation systems, wikis, photo-sharing systems, social news sites, "
"social music sites, podcasting servers, blogs, version control systems, and "
"general purpose social networks would all be candidates for OStatus use. "
