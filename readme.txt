A better way to tell the world when your blog is updated.

== Description ==

This plugin is a simple way to let people know in real-time when your blog is updated.  PubSubHubbub/WebSub is widely adopted and is used by Google Alerts and many other services.  Subscription requests are relayed through hubs, which validate and verify the request. Hubs then distribute new and updated content to subscribers when it becomes available.

This plugin:

* Sends realtime notifications when you update your blog
* Supports multi-user installations (Wordpress MU)
* Supports multiple hubs
* Supports all of the feed formats used by WordPress, not just ATOM and RSS2
* Supports latest specs
	* PubSubHubbub [Version 0.4](https://pubsubhubbub.github.io/PubSubHubbub/pubsubhubbub-core-0.4.html)
	* WebSub [W3C Version](https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/)
* Announces which hubs you are using by adding `<link rel="hub" ...>` declarations to your template header and Atom feed

By default this plugin will ping the following hubs:

* [Demo hub on Google App Engine](https://pubsubhubbub.appspot.com "Demo hub on Google App Engine")
* [SuperFeedr](https://pubsubhubbub.superfeedr.com "SuperFeedr")
* [WebSubHub](https://websubhub.com "WebSubHub")

Please contact me if you operate a hub that you would like to be included as a default option.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `pubsubhubub` directory to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Select custom hubs under your WebSub/PubSubHubbub Settings (optional)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is WebSub? =

WebSub provides a common mechanism for communication between publishers of any kind of Web content and their subscribers, based on HTTP web hooks. Subscription requests are relayed through hubs, which validate and verify the request. Hubs then distribute new and updated content to subscribers when it becomes available. WebSub was previously known as PubSubHubbub.

= What is a Hub? =

A WebSub Hub is an implementation that handles subscription requests and distributes the content to subscribers when the corresponding topic URL has been updated. Hubs MUST support subscription requests with a secret and deliver authenticated requests when requested. Hubs MUST deliver the full contents of the topic URL in the request, and MAY reduce the payload to a diff if the content type supports it.

= What is a Publisher? =

A WebSub Publisher is an implementation that advertises a topic and hub URL on one or more resource URLs.

= What is a Subscriber? =

A WebSub Subscriber is an implementation that discovers the hub and topic URL given a resource URL, subscribes to updates at the hub, and accepts content distribution requests from the hub. The subscriber MAY support authenticated content distribution.
